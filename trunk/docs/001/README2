This is the first version of eFTE/2. It is based on eFTE (see README.efte) which in 
turn is based on FTE (Folding Text Editor). The configuration now compiles on
the fly. You should be able to use it with the configuration files of an existing
FTE install simply by creating a mymain.fte file in the same directory as your
old main.fte. The file must include the line #include 'main.fte'. You could also
use the mymain.fte and sysmain.fte files from the package. Simply copy them to
the directory main.fte is in. You will need to edit mymain to set the UI and color
scheme as it will override the settings in main.fte. Another alternative is to
rename your main.fte mymain.fte or use -Cmain.fte on the command line. If eFTE/2 
can't find your configuration SET EFTEDIR in config.sys to point to the directory 
your main.fte is in.

I have structured the configuration files to make it easier to translate the menus.
I lack the language skills to do the translations. If you have an opportunity to do
one or more of the translations please send them to me a ygk@qwest.net. The menu files
are located in the menu_xx (where xx is the language code) subdirectories of the
config directory. The keyboard files included there are present so you can change the
accel keys for accessing the menus if needed. Note the key you want to use my already
be in use so you will need to switch them. You may add any language with a 2 letter
code. Simple create a menu_xx subdirectory using the code and place the menus in it.
To use them start eFTE/2 with -Lxx (xx = language code) on the command line. You can
also use -L to override the language default which is based on your systems LANG 
environment variable. The edefault.fte also could be translated. If you are interested 
in translating the documentation (help file etc) please contact me.
